## Get started

1. Install dependencies for Front-End and Back-End

   For the Front-End in the main directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   For the Back-End in backend/
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   In the backend:

   In the root directory:
   ```bash

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

Currently, we have done our testing on the web, and still need to check if it works on mobile. As of now
only have it print out user's information.
